For all code: consider when to pass by reference
            : add destructors, etc.

Consider using an enum for output or doing output with a separate class



Output objects

Currently, field class maintains outFiles list and manages output files/nodes. This should be done by a seperate class.

Monitor does not handle a single point well - add support for this

Solve the pause at the end of the program (problem caused by H5)


Follow Rule: 1 Class per CPP file, 1 header file per CPP file
    (also change .h for .hpp)
